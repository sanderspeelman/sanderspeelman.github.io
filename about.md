My name is Sander Speelman and I have created this blog in March 2021. I use this blog to share knowledge and experience from the field.

Iâ€™m currently an Application Specialist at Fikira focused on the End-User Computing area. I'm primarily focusing on application packaging in centralized desktop environments.
